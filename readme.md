Welcome to the Machine Intelligence Lecture Series. I had the priviledge of conducting this lecture series at the UAV Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). The aim of this series was to provide my teammates with an overview of various Machine Intelligence concepts and technologies. Throughout the series, I covered a range of topics, delving into both foundational principles and advanced applications.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Statistical Machine Learning

In this section, I explored the fundamentals of statistical machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We discussed concepts such as linear regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques. Practical implementations and real-world examples were also showcased to illustrate the relevance of these methods.

### 2. Deep Learning

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, was a central focus of this segment. We delved into the architecture and mechanics of neural networks, covering feedforward networks, backpropagation, activation functions, and gradient descent optimization. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were introduced, with insights into their applications in image and sequence data analysis.

### 3. Neural ODEs

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) represent an exciting advancement in the field of deep learning. Our lectures on this topic delved into the concept of treating neural networks as continuous dynamical systems described by differential equations. Participants gained an understanding of how this approach can model complex processes and capture temporal dependencies in data.

### 4. Liquid Neural Networks

Liquid Neural Networks are an intriguing variant of recurrent neural networks that draw inspiration from biological neural systems. This part of the lecture series covered the unique architecture of Liquid Neural Networks and their applications in tasks requiring dynamic memory and complex pattern recognition. The comparison between Liquid Neural Networks and traditional RNNs shed light on the advantages of this novel approach.

### 5. Biology Inspired Neural Networks

The final segment explored neural networks inspired by biological systems. We delved into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and explored how they mimic the behavior of biological neurons. Topics included neural encoding, spike trains, and SNN architectures. Participants gained insights into the potential of SNNs for neuromorphic computing and real-time event-based processing.
