# ArduPilot and Jetson Nano integration for GPS-denied UAV applications

This blog documents my journey of controlling my UAV using my own vision algorithms. The blog follows the following outline. I will fill in the topics as I progress.

### Outline

1. Introduction
    - Briefly introduce the topic and the purpose of the blog post.
    - Explain the importance of GPS-less navigation and the role of the Jetson Nano.
2. Hardware Setup
    - The hardware used, including the drone, the Pixhawk flight controller, and the Jetson Nano.
    - A step-by-step guide on how to connect the Pixhawk to the Jetson Nano.

3. Software Setup
   - Set up the Jetson Nano and the necessary software packages.
   - A guide on how to configure the Pixhawk for MAVLink communication.

4. Code Explanation
   - The Python code used for MAVLink communication.
   - The code explained in detail, including how it interacts with the Pixhawk and controls the drone.

5. Testing and Results
   - How to test your setup?
   - Test results.

6. Conclusion
   - Summary the blog post.
   - My final thoughts, future plans, or any other concluding remarks.

7. References
8. Progress Tracker
   - My progress documented as part of milestones and labs.
   - Project: An implementation exercise.

### Progress Tracker

#### Labs
As part of my journey, I will write a series of labs in the form of blog posts. These serve as the milestones and as the step-by-step guideline for anyone who wisesh to learn. The labs include:

| # | Lab | Description |
| - | --- | --- | 
| 1 |     |     |
| 2 |     |     |
| 3 |     |     |
| 4 | Lab 4 | Flying your UAV in AirSim |
| 5 |     |     |
| 6 |     |     |
| 7 |     |     |


#### Project: An implementation exercise.
