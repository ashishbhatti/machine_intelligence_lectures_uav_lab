# Tello Drone Programming 

This repo is based on the [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/LmEcyQnfpDA?si=Usu-OyuNNst9qtV9) by Murtaza's Workshop youtube channel. The purpose of completing this tutorial is to get a feel of controlling a drone via code. Now in the video by drone the creator means a rotary wing UAV.

As I do not own a Tello yet, I will run my code on DroneBlocks simulation.
