'''
Odometry Problem: How to localize the drone in the surroundings?

We will take the velocity information, to find the distance.
We will also use angular speed, to find the angle of drone,
or where it is headed. Based on this we will find the x,y coordinates
of the drone.

So, we will take the distance and angle and we will convert it into
cartesian coordinates, and plot it into a graph.
