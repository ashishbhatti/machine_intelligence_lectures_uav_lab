# Instructions to setup ROS2 on ubuntu 22.04

I decided to install ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy). The reason is ROS2 Humble is an LTS version, which means Long Terms Support. The EOL for ROS2 Humble is in May 2027.

I decided to go with ROS2 because I thought I should work on something new, rather than again going back to ROS1.


## Upon fresh Ubuntu install

Run these commands after fresh ubuntu install:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove

sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install build-essential gcc make perl dkms
sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo apt install terminator
```
